<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The <strong>Swapp</strong> system is a software product designed to facilitate the trade of goods
between its users.</p>
<p>The system will be operated over a web portal accessible on a variety of different
browsers and platforms. The system will securely store a large number of user profiles,
each of which will include some personal information, a log-in ID and password, a list of
products they want, and a list of products they have and are willing to trade. By
browsing the site, users will find others users who want something they have, or have
something they want. They can then send a swap proposal to the other user so that
they can meet and swap products.
A need for the system was identified when a social network group of college students
offering free or tradeable products became wildly popular. A specific Swapping software
system could eliminate the social network middleman and provide features especially
useful for swapping products.
Users must be able to edit their information and their Haves and Wants lists, search
through other users’ Haves and Wants lists, and send requests to other users for
proposed Swaps. They must also be log-in, log-out, and delete their account if need be.
The system should accommodate user needs wherever possible, without losing focus
on its core purpose of providing a means for people to trade goods.
The software designers and customers must also be aware of any potential legal and
moral issues that could arise from creating a social system based around trading goods.
There should be safety measures in place to prevent the system from being used for
unsavory practices like drug trading, or any other illegal product. Measures should also
be put into place to curb harassment, as harassment and hate speech are tremendous
problems for many social networks. For these reasons, it’s necessary that there be a
special class of user administrators that can ban certain accounts and edit information if they’re found engaging in illegal or immoral activity. These administrators should be onhand
indefinitely when the software is deployed to the public.</p>
